					Eleven46 is a Belgian company specialised in making
					fashionable socks. The designs are made at their Brussels HQ
					and made with the finest precision in Italy. They are still
					pretty young. They are available in stores and online on
					www.eleven46.co. Eleven46 refers to the smallest and largest
					size in socks (standard sizes). That's why we found it
					original to take that name. We tried many other options but
					this one sounded the best. We knew it was going to be
					challenging but people are liking the name more and more.
