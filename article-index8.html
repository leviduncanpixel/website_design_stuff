					Wooden Kingdom is a young enterprise taking its first steps
					in the clothing business. It focuses on quality and solidity
					of its products. These products are addressed to true,
					strong men who are not afraid to face up to the nature’s
					elements. The brand’s atmosphere follows the “Urban
					Lumberjack” style. Lumberjacks are workers in the logging
					industry who perform the initial harvesting and transport of
					trees for ultimate processing into forest products.

					The author created a distinctive image of the brand basing
					on a functional and minimalist design. The main
					identification of the brand is a bear. It is perceived as
					the king of mountains, symbolized by wildness, bravery,
					“maleness”; the bear demands respect as well.

					Within his work the author created elements of branding
					identity: logotype variants, letterheads, envelopes,
					visiting cards, accessories, identity book.
